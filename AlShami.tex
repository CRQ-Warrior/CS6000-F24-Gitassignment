\section{Introduction}
I am Ali Alshami, a Ph.D. student in computer science and a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at the Vision Security Technology (VAST) Lab, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS).

My goal for the course is to finish and submit a survey paper on human action recognition and prediction and start a new paper that focuses on predicting the future movement of humans based on human pose estimation and motion information. The survey paper reviews and evaluates the recent human actions recognition and prediction papers based on vision and machine learning. The new work will be focused on predicting the future movement of humans in video based on past movement, motion information, and human pose estimation.

I hope to learn more about improving my research skills and what I must consider becoming a better researcher. I am also curious about how to convert research that we are working on to a product you and what things we need to consider to make it a successful product.

I enjoy outdoor activities, including running, hiking, mountain biking, tennis, pickle-ball, and snowboarding. I also like reading and playing piano sometimes.
