# CS6000-F24-Gitassignment

Checkout  (clone/fork) out git repo from  git@github.com:tboult/CS6000-F24-Gitassignment.git

 

You are to make a new latex file, named after your last name-F24, e.g. I would be Boult-F24.tex.  In that file copy some of your first assignment latex about yourself, including photos, putting photos in the images subdirectory 

Then, find a git repo that has code related to your research, download and test it, and add a short description of your experience and link it to your personal file and showing a some of the output of that code running.    Make a branch with your name.  Then, add associated files to the repo and commit it with a comment.    Then update Assignment3-git.tex file to \include your file.  Make sure all latex compiles properly and shows your content.  Then, commit/push your changes.  You need to make your changes in a branch and do testing on that branch; You must merge everything back to the master branch when done -- do not just do pull requests to get it back into the original repo and expect me to deal with merge issues

After at least 2 other people from this year have uploaded their files, you are to edit one of their files to ask them a question at the end of their file.  You are to ask at least 2 people questions, and no one can be asked more than 2 questions.   When someone asks you a question, you are to update your file to answer.   If there are any merge conflicts,  deal with them and describe how you resolved them in the document.  Upload the final pdf in Canvas.
