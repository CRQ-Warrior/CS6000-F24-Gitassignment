	abstract = {In this paper we propose the Advanced Deep Learning Graphics Pipeline ({ADLGP}). {ADLGP} is a novel approach that uses existing deep learning architectures to convert scene data into rendered images. Our goal of generating frames from semantic data has produced successful renderings with similar structures and composition as target frames. We demonstrate the success of {ADLGP} with side-by-side comparisons of frames generated through standard rendering procedures. We assert that a fully implemented {ADLGP} framework would reduce the time spent in visualizing 3D environments, and help selectively offload the requirements of the current graphics rendering pipeline.},

	abstract = {Efficiently rendering direct lighting from millions of dynamic light sources using Monte Carlo integration remains a challenging problem, even for off-line rendering systems. We introduce a new algorithm---{ReSTIR}---that renders such lighting interactively, at high quality, and without needing to maintain complex data structures. We repeatedly resample a set of candidate light samples and apply further spatial and temporal resampling to leverage information from relevant nearby samples. We derive an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator for this approach, and show that it achieves equal-error 6×-60× faster than state-of-the-art methods. A biased estimator reduces noise further and is 35×-65× faster, at the cost of some energy loss. We implemented our approach on the {GPU}, rendering complex scenes containing up to 3.4 million dynamic, emissive triangles in under 50 ms per frame while tracing at most 8 rays per pixel.},
