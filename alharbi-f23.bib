	abstract = {In this paper we propose the Advanced Deep Learning Graphics Pipeline ({ADLGP}). {ADLGP} is a novel approach that uses existing deep learning architectures to convert scene data into rendered images. Our goal of generating frames from semantic data has produced successful renderings with similar structures and composition as target frames. We demonstrate the success of {ADLGP} with side-by-side comparisons of frames generated through standard rendering procedures. We assert that a fully implemented {ADLGP} framework would reduce the time spent in visualizing 3D environments, and help selectively offload the requirements of the current graphics rendering pipeline.},
