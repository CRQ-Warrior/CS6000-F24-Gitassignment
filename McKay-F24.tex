\section{About Me}
I am a 2nd year PhD student at UCCS.  I haven't yet published a paper but I'm working on it.  My area of research I think is one of the most challenging in all of cybersecurity, Cyber Risk Quantification.  Its taken me some time to figure out how this problem is best approached and I think the answer lies in a deep classification and analysis of the interactions of Attackers and Defenders. There may be several derivations from this interaction, but since my attention is on cyber risk quantification, my focus is on "Susceptibility".
